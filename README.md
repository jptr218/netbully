### Netbully is a tool to close connections between remote hosts that you cannot sniff. It achieves this by spoofing an ICMP host unreachable message from one host to the other, making the one recvieving believe that the other endpoint is down. It requires the [WinPCap Network Driver](https://www.winpcap.org/default.htm) to run.
## Netbully can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/jptr218/netbully/raw/main/netbully.exe)
### Usage:
